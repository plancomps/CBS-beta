Compiler Coding Dojo
--------------------

The FunCons session at CoCoDo 2018 gives participants the opportunity to try
compiling programs to so-called 'funcons' (fundamental programming constructs).

A collection of funcons is essentially a very high level intermediate language.
The operational definitions of funcons are reusable components of language
specifications, and can be interpreted to run funcon terms. Compilation of a 
language to funcons supports agile rapid prototyping during its development.
A formal definition of the compilation also provides a formal semantics for
the language.

At this dojo, participants will use the beta-release of the current collection
of funcons, and specify compilation of a simple demonstration language (SL) to
funcons using the CBS meta-language for component-based semantics developed by
the [PLanCompS project](http://www.plancomps.org). Browsing, editing, and
running the specifications are supported by editors generated using 
[Spoofax](http://spoofax.readthedocs.io).
