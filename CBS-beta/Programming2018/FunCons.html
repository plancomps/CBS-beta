<h2>Compiler Coding Dojo</h2>

<p>The FunCons session at CoCoDo 2018 gives participants the opportunity to try
compiling programs to so-called 'funcons' (fundamental programming constructs).</p>

<p>A collection of funcons is essentially a very high level intermediate language.
The operational definitions of funcons are reusable components of language
specifications, and can be interpreted to run funcon terms. Compilation of a 
language to funcons supports agile rapid prototyping during its development.
A formal definition of the compilation also provides a formal semantics for
the language.</p>

<p>At this dojo, participants will use the beta-release of the current collection
of funcons, and specify compilation of a simple demonstration language (SL) to
funcons using the CBS meta-language for component-based semantics developed by
the <a href="http://www.plancomps.org">PLanCompS project</a>. Browsing, editing, and
running the specifications are supported by editors generated using 
<a href="http://spoofax.readthedocs.io">Spoofax</a>.</p>
