Funcons-beta ![PREVIEW](preview.png)
============

**(The CBS-beta website is currently being constructed. This preview of it**
**will be updated when complete and ready for review.)**

This page will provide access to the beta-release of an initial collection of
so-called 'funcons' (fundamental programming constructs).

Funcons are reusable components of programming language specifications:
a language is specified by translating its constructs to funcon terms,
reusing (by reference) the definitions of the required [funcons].

Some initial examples of component-based language specifications will be
provided at [Languages-beta].
