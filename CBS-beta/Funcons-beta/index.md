Funcons-beta ![PREVIEW](preview.png)
============

**(The CBS-beta website is currently being constructed. This preview of it**
**will be updated when complete and ready for review.)**

This page provides access to the beta-release of an initial collection of
so-called 'funcons' (fundamental programming constructs).

Funcons (fundamental programming constructs) are reusable components of 
programming language specifications: in the [CBS framework], a language is
specified by defining a translation from its constructs to funcon terms,
reusing (by reference) the definitions of the required funcons. 
See [Languages-beta] for examples of language specifications in CBS.
