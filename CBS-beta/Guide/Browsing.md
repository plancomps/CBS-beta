CBS-beta Browsing Guide
=======================

Navigation
----------

**All references to names of funcons (etc.) in CBS files are hyperlinks leading
to their declarations.**

Use of these hyperlinks avoids the need to become familiar with the hierarchy of
folders and files in the funcons library, and to drill down through it to find
declarations.

The global [Funcons-Index] page has hyperlinks to all funcons, with those 
defined in the same file grouped together. Similarly for local indexes
of funcons used in the CBS of particular languages.

  The large button at the top right of each CBS page is a fixed drop-down menu.
    
  For pages in the `Funcons-beta` folder, it has the following links:
  - [Funcons-beta]: the funcon index
  - [Languages-beta]: the languages overview 
  - [CBS-beta]: the CBS-beta overview

  For pages in the `Languages-beta/L` folder, it has also the following links:
  - `L-Start`: the root of the CBS of language `L` (which includes links to
    all the other sections for that language)
  - `L-Funcons-Index`: the index of funcons used for language `L`
