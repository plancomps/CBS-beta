Caml Light ![PREVIEW](../../Funcons-beta/preview.png)
==========

Caml Light is a lightweight, portable implementation of the core Caml language
that was developed in the early 1990's, as a precursor to OCaml. A concise
[Caml Light manual] is available online. An operational semantics of a
comaprable sublanguage of OCaml has been given in the Ott framework.

Caml Light, abbreviated "CL", is useful for illustrating the CBS of a 
functional programming language. A CBS of CL was published in 2016;
completion of an updated version based on Funcons-beta is pending.
