SIMPLE
======

Grigore Rosu and Traian Florin Serbanuta gave a definition of
[SIMPLE in the K framework]. They wrote:

SIMPLE is a somewhat larger imperative language than IMP. Its CBS illustrates
further features of the framework. The start of the specification of SIMPLE in
CBS is at [SIMPLE-Start].

Note that the CBS specification of SIMPLE does not yet include threads, since
funcons for threads are not yet available.
