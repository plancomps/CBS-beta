Languages-beta ![PREVIEW](../Funcons-beta/preview.png)
==============

**(The CBS-beta website is currently being constructed. This preview of it**
**will be updated when complete and ready for review.)**

This page provides access to the beta-release of several examples of language
specifications in CBS, based on an initial collection of so-called 'funcons' 
(fundamental programming constructs). Funcons are reusable components of 
programming language specifications: in the [CBS framework], a language is 
specified by defining a translation from its constructs to funcon terms, 
reusing (by reference) the definitions of the required funcons. 

See [Funcons-beta] for the beta-release of an initial collection of funcons.

Before proceeding, it is recommended to take a look at the 
[CBS-beta language specification reading guide].

IMP
---

Grigore Rosu gave a definition of [IMP in the K framework]. He wrote:

> IMP is considered a folklore language, without an official inventor, 
> and has been used in many textbooks and papers, often with slight 
> syntactic variations and often without being called IMP. It includes 
> the most basic imperative language constructs, namely basic constructs 
> for arithmetic and Boolean expressions, and variable assignment, 
> conditional, while loop and sequential composition constructs for statements.

IMP is useful for a first illustration of CBS. The start of the definition of 
IMP in CBS is at [IMP-Start].
