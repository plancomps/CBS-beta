Languages-beta ![PREVIEW](Funcons-beta/preview.png)
==============

This page will provide access to the beta-release of examples of component-based
language specifications based on an initial collection of
so-called 'funcons' (fundamental programming constructs).

Funcons are reusable components of programming language specifications:
a language is specified by translating its constructs to funcon terms,
reusing (by reference) the definitions of the required funcons.

The beta-release of an initial collection of funcons will be provided at 
[Funcons-beta].
