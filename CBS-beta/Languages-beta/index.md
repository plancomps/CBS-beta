Languages-beta ![PREVIEW](../Funcons-beta/preview.png)
==============

**(The CBS-beta website is currently being constructed. This preview of it**
**will be updated when complete and ready for review.)**

This page provides access to the beta-release of several examples of language
specifications in CBS, based on an initial collection of so-called 'funcons' 
(fundamental programming constructs). Funcons are reusable components of 
programming language specifications: in the [CBS framework], a language is 
specified by defining a translation from its constructs to funcon terms, 
reusing (by reference) the definitions of the required funcons. 

See [Funcons-beta] for the beta-release of an initial collection of funcons.

Before proceeding, it is recommended to take a look at the 
[CBS-beta language specification reading guide].

IMP
---

IMP is a very small imperative language, useful for illustration of the basic
features of the CBS framework. See the page about the definition of 
[IMP in CBS] for further details.

SIMPLE
------

SIMPLE is a somewhat larger imperative language than IMP, useful for
illustration of further features of the CBS framework. See the page about the 
definition of [SIMPLE in CBS] for further details. 

MiniJava
--------

MiniJava is a very simple subset of Java, useful for illustrating the CBS
funcons for classes and objects. See the page about the 
definition of [MiniJava in CBS] for further details.
