SL
==

The SimpleLanguage, abbreviated "SL", is a dynamic demonstration language.
It was built using [Truffle for the GraalVM] at Oracle Labs.
A specification of [SL in DynSem] has been given by Vlad Vergu.

Its CBS illustrates how dynamic bindings can be translated to funcons.
The start of the specification of SL in CBS is at [SL-Start].
