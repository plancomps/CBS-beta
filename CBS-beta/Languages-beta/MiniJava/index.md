MiniJava
========

Joao Cangussu, Jens Palsberg and Vidyut Samanta gave a BNF grammar for a very
simple subset of Java in the [MiniJava project]. They wrote:

MiniJava is a very simple subset of Java. Its CBS illustrates the funcons
for classes and objects. The start of the specification of MiniJava in CBS
is at [MiniJava-Start].
