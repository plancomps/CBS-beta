OCaml Light ![PREVIEW](../../Funcons-beta/preview.png)
===========

[Caml Light] is a lightweight, portable implementation of the core Caml 
language that was developed in the early 1990's, as a precursor to OCaml. 
A concise [Caml Light manual] is available online. The [specification of Caml 
Light] in a preliminary version of CBS was published in 2016.

Scott Owens gave an operational semantics of a corresponding sublanguage of 
OCaml, dubbed 'OCaml Light', using the [Ott framework]. OCaml Light is useful
for illustrating the use of funcons for specifying the semantics of
higher-order functional programming language features. A CBS of 
OCaml Light is to appear here.
