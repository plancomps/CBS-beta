# LangDev-2019 declaration not found

A URL of the form `.../CBS-beta/Unstable-Languages-beta/LangDev-2019#id` should redirect to
a web page that displays the declaration of the name indicated by `id`.
For example,
[...CBS-beta/Unstable-Languages-beta#SyntaxName:exp](/CBS-beta/Unstable-Languages-beta/LangDev-2019#SyntaxName:exp)
redirects to
[...CBS-beta/math/Unstable-Languages-beta/LangDev-2019/LD-cbs/LD/LD-Start/#SyntaxName:exp](/CBS-beta/math/Unstable-Languages-beta/LangDev-2019/LD-cbs/LD/LD-Start/#SyntaxName:exp).

Redirection to the present page indicates that the name indicated by `id`
is not declared in the Unstable-Languages-beta/LangDev-2019 specification.
This could be due to the omission of a `SyntaxName:` or `SemanticsName:` prefix,
or a spelling error in the name itself.
