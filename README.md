[CBS-beta]
==========

_CBS_ is a framework and meta-language for _component-based specification of
programming languages_. The main idea is to translate languages to so-called
_'funcons'_ ([fundamental programming constructs]). The behaviour of the funcons
has already been specified, so translating a language to funcons determines the
behaviour of programs in that language.

Funcons are to have *fixed* definitions, so *no version control* will be needed
for their safe reuse in CBS [language specifications]. The aim of this 
[beta-release of CBS] and its initial library of funcons is to allow review 
of the current funcon definitions, and subsequent adoption of suggestions 
for improvement, before their full release.

The development of the CBS framework, meta-language, and tool support,
together with examples of language specification using CBS,
is the main activity of the [PLanCompS] project.
PLanCompS is an open international collaboration,
and [new participants] are welcome!
