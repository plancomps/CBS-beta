[IMP]
=====

Grigore Rosu gave a definition of [IMP in the K framework]. He wrote:

> IMP is considered a folklore language, without an official inventor,
> and has been used in many textbooks and papers, often with slight
> syntactic variations and often without being called IMP. It includes
> the most basic imperative language constructs, namely basic constructs
> for arithmetic and Boolean expressions, and variable assignment,

IMP is a very small imperative language. Its CBS specification illustrates the
basic features of the framework. The start of the specification of IMP in CBS
is at [IMP].
