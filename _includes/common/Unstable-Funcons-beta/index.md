Unstable-Funcons-beta
=====================

New funcons are likely to be introduced in the beta-release period. Compared to
the funcons in [Funcons-beta], the new specifications may be less well tested,
and relatively unstable, so they are listed separately.

See [Unstable-Languages-beta] for illustrative examples of language
specifications using the unstable funcons.

Unstable-Funcons-Index
----------------------

The [Unstable-Funcons-Index] page lists the names of all the unstable funcons.
The list is grouped in the same way as the hierarchy of CBS files in which the
funcons are defined. The names are hyperlinked to their definitions; familiarity
with the hierarchy is not required for navigating CBS specifications.

Computations
----------------------

The [Computations] page introduces the various kinds of computations defined
in the library.
