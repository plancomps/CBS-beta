Computations
=====================

New funcons are introduced here. Compared to the funcons in [Funcons-beta],
the new specifications may be less well tested, and relatively unstable, so
they are listed separately.

See [Unstable-Languages-beta] for illustrative examples of language
specifications using the unstable funcons.

[Threads]
---------

Multithreading funcons have effects on mutable entities that represent the
collection of threads, the set of active threads, the thread being executed,
the values computed by terminated threads, and scheduling information.

[Normal computation]
--------------------

These funcons are potentially of general use, but first defined for use in
connection with languages that include threads.

[Abnormal computation]
----------------------

These funcons are potentially of general use, but first defined for use in
connection with languages that include threads.
