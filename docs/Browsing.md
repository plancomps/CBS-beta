## Navigation

> __All references to names of funcons (etc.) in CBS specifications are
> hyperlinks leading to their declarations.__

These hyperlinks avoid the need to drill down through the hierarchy of folders and files.
Specifications in CBS are independent of the file system:
all names declared in [Funcons-beta] are globally visible,
and names declared in a particular language specification are local to that language,
regardless of where the specification files are located.

The global Funcons-Index page lists the names of all current funcons, grouped by file.
The local Funcons-Index page for a particular language lists only the names of the funcons actually used in its specification.

The [Funcon Reuse] page shows which of the languages in [Languages-beta] reference each funcon.

Hovering on a reference to a funcon displays the declared arity of symbol:
`values` stands for a *single* argument, and `values*` for any number of arguments.

## Web pages

{:.note}
> The color scheme switches between light and dark to match the system/browser preference.
