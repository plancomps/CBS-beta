Funcons-beta
============

This page provides access to the beta-release of an initial collection of
so-called 'funcons' (fundamental programming constructs). Funcons are reusable
components of programming language specifications: in the [CBS framework],
a language is specified by defining a translation from its constructs to
funcon terms, reusing (by reference) the definitions of the required funcons.

See [Languages-beta] for illustrative examples of language specifications in
CBS.

Before proceeding, it is recommended to take a look at the funcon definition
section of the CBS-beta [Browsing guide].

Funcons-Index
-------------

The [Funcons-Index] page lists the names of all the funcons defined in the
PLanCompS library. The list is grouped in the same way as the hierarchy of
CBS files in which the funcons are defined. The names are hyperlinked to their
definitions; familiarity with the hierarchy is not required for navigating
CBS specifications.

Computations
------------

The [Computations] page introduces the various kinds of computations defined
in the library.

Values
------

The [Values] page introduces the various kinds of values defined in the library.
