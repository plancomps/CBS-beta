Compiler Coding Dojo
--------------------

The FunCons session at CoCoDo 2018 gives participants the opportunity to try
compiling a programming language to so-called 'funcons' (fundamental programming
constructs).

A collection of funcons is essentially a very high level intermediate language.
The operational definitions of funcons are reusable components of language
specifications, and can be interpreted to run funcon terms. Compilation of a
language to funcons supports agile rapid prototyping during its development.
A formal definition of the compilation also provides a formal semantics for
the language.

At this dojo, participants will use the beta-release of the current collection
of funcons, and specify compilation of parts of SL to funcons using the CBS
meta-language for component-based semantics developed by the
[PLanCompS](http://www.plancomps.org)
project.
[SL](https://github.com/graalvm/simplelanguage)
is a simple dynamic demonstration language built using Truffle for the GraalVM at
[Oracle Labs](https://labs.oracle.com).
Browsing, editing, and running the specifications are supported
by editors generated using the
[Spoofax](http://spoofax.readthedocs.io)
language workbench in Eclipse.
