/*
The funcons for threads are tentative. They have not yet been rigorously
unit-tested, nor used significantly in language definitions.

The [multithreading] funcons involve multiple mutable entities, and are
generally specified by inference rules with premises involving the values of
those entities before and after a transition.

The [synchronising] funcons only involve the `store` entity, and wrap
compound funcon terms in `thread-atomic(_)` to inhibit preemption.

Some of the unit tests are based on examples in an [IBM threads] guide.
