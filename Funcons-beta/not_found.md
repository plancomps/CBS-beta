# Funcons-beta declaration not found

A URL of the form `.../CBS-beta/Funcons-beta#id` should redirect to
a web page that displays the declaration of the funcon indicated by `id`.
For example,
[...CBS-beta/Funcons-beta#Name:scope](/CBS-beta/Funcons-beta#Name:scope)
redirects to
[...CBS-beta/math/Funcons-beta/Computations/Normal/Binding/#Name:scope](/CBS-beta/math/Funcons-beta/Computations/Normal/Binding/#Name:scope).

Redirection to the present page indicates that the funcon indicated by `id`
is not declared in the Funcons-beta collection.
This could be due to the omission of the `Name:` prefix,
or a spelling error.
